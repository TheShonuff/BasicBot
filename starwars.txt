Fear leads to the dark side
I am your father
obi wan will save us
I find your lack of faith disturbing
The Force will be with you
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope
Never Tell me the odds
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder!
Do. Or do not. There is no try
Now, young Skywalker, you will die 
There's always a bigger fish
